You'll need a file called config.js in the root that looks like this, with your relevant data.
Mine is untracked for obvious reasons. 

module.exports = {
    consumer_key:         '...',
    consumer_secret:      '...',
    access_token:         '...',
    access_token_secret:  '...',
    timeout_ms:           60*1000,  // optional HTTP request timeout to apply to all requests.

}
